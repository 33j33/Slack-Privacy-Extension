## üìù Description

The extension helps protect your privacy while using Slack in a browser by blurring messages, media, and other content until you need to view them. Perfect for those who work in public spaces, frequently share their screen during meetings, or just want an added layer of privacy for their Slack conversations.

## ‚ú® Features

- **One-Click Privacy Toggle**: Quickly enable or disable privacy mode from the extension popup
- **Global Keyboard Shortcut**: You can also toggle privacy mode with shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+2` (Windows/Linux) or `Command+Shift+2` (Mac). This allows you to toggle message blur instantly without having to click the extension icon from anywhere.

  **Example scenario**: You're in the middle of presenting your screen during a meeting when suddenly you receive a private Slack message. Instead of frantically trying to minimize the window, simply press `Ctrl+Shift+2` (or `Command+Shift+2` on Mac) to immediately blur all private messages. Press the shortcut again to disable privacy mode when you're ready to view your messages.
      
    _Note for Firefox users_: The shortcut functionality is currently not supported globally in Firefox due to browser limitations though it can used when slack tab is in focus. 

- **Selective Content Blurring**: Choose which elements to blur:
  - Message content
  - Media and file attachments
  - Link previews
  - Huddle message notifications
  - Reaction bars (emoji reactions and reply buttons)
  - Public channels (optional - not blurred by default)
- **Hover to Reveal**: Simply hover over any blurred content to temporarily reveal it
- **Customizable Timing**: Adjust how quickly content reveals on hover (from instant to 10 seconds)
- **Smart Channel Detection**: Public channels can remain unblurred by default
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact on your Slack experience

### Is my data secure with this extension?

Yes. This extension operates entirely on the client side (your browser) and does not collect, transmit, or store any of your Slack data. It simply applies visual CSS filters to blur content until you hover over it.

### Does this extension work in all Slack workspaces?

Yes, the extension works in all Slack workspaces accessed via a web browser. It doesn't affect the Slack desktop application.

### Why aren't public channels blurred by default?

We've found that most users prefer to keep public channel content visible while blurring direct messages and private channels. You can enable blurring for public channels in the extension settings if desired.

### Will people know I'm using this extension?

No. The extension only affects how Slack appears in your browser and doesn't modify any behavior that would be visible to other Slack users.

### Does the extension work with Slack's dark mode?

Yes, the extension is fully compatible with both light and dark Slack themes.
